In this current practice we need to resolve this example:

You are automating the  https://www.saucedemo.com/ web application. 
Create a new Selenium - Java - TestNG project, and configure it to launch and test the required webpage on Chrome browser. Implement on your framework the following scenarios, each one as a different test:

Purchase a product: Follow the complete buyflow of the page, selecting a random product, adding it to the cart, adding the personal data, and check you are successfully arriving at the “Thank you for your purchase” page.
Removing elements of the shopping cart: Add 3 different elements to the shopping cart, enter to the cart page, remove them and check the shopping cart is empty.
Logout: try to log out and check if you are correctly redirected to the login page.

	For this implementation, follow the rules described next:
	
Page Object Model should be correctly implemented, making sure to reuse certain elements and define base pages as needed for common methods and elements.
Page factory is required.
Before annotations should be used to manage preconditions. Any other required annotations can be implemented as needed.
